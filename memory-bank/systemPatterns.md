# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

```
src/
├── bot.js              # Main bot entry point
├── database/
│   └── db.js           # Database operations
├── twitter/
│   └── index.js        # Twitter API integration
└── utils/
    └── logger.js       # Logging utilities
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. Module Pattern

- Each major component (Twitter, Database, Bot) is separated into its own module
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend

### 2. Repository Pattern

- Database operations are abstracted in db.js
- Provides clean interface for data access
- Makes it easy to change storage implementation

### 3. Service Pattern

- Twitter service handles all Twitter API interactions
- Bot service manages Discord interactions
- Clear boundaries between external services

## Component Relationships

### Data Flow

1. Twitter API → Twitter Service
2. Twitter Service → Database (check for duplicates)
3. Database → Bot Service
4. Bot Service → Discord Channel

### Error Handling

- Each layer has its own error handling
- Errors are logged and handled appropriately
- Failures don't crash the entire system

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Database Choice

- SQLite for simplicity and reliability
- No need for external database server
- Easy to backup and maintain

### 2. API Integration

- Twitter API v2 for modern features
- Bearer token authentication for simplicity
- Rate limit handling built-in

### 3. Process Management

- PM2 for production deployment
- Automatic restarts on failure
- Process monitoring

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability

- Current design allows for easy addition of new social media sources
- Database schema can be extended
- Service pattern makes it easy to add new features

### 2. Maintenance

- Clear logging for debugging
- Modular design for easy updates
- Clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance
